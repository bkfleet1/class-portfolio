        <p>
          My name is Brad Kelley. I have over 25-years of experience as a technology consultant and recently endeavored
          to
          become a full-stack software developer. In 2002, I co-founded Mercury Associates, Inc. (“Mercury”), the
          largest
          independent fleet consulting and technology services firm in North America. I served as the firm’s Senior Vice
          President and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for 20-years until the company was purchased by CDPQ, a leading
          global private equity platform. As the firms CTO, I led the firm's Technology Consulting Services & Cloud
          Services business lines, which provided advisory and technical services as well as SaaS and IaaS.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2020, I departed Mercury to pursue a long-time dream of becoming a software developer, creating native web
          applications with intuitive, visually stunning interfaces. I am particularly passionate about solutions that
          harmonize and visualize complex business activities in a “single pane of glass” – unifying diverse data
          streams
          and technologies, such as business systems, IoT and geospatial data, artificial intelligence, and analytics.
          Additionally, I am highly interested in skeuomorphic and neumorphic UI designs to improve software usability.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently pursuing a full-stack developer certification with Rice University, which should be awarded by
          April 2022. I also hold a master's in public administration (MPA) with Southern Illinois University and a
          bachelor's (BS) in international business with Spring Hill College.
        </p>
        <p>
          My wife, Bobi, and I have two adult children, four grandchildren, and five dogs. We also raise honey bees on
          our
          farm in New Waverly, Texas.

          <h2>Mobile Responsiveness</h2>
          <p>
            Run Buddy is a site that I created as part of my full-stack developer training. A core feature is its ability to dynamically scale fonts and images, as well as placement of site content at different screen resolutions – a necessity with the ubiquitous use and diversity of mobile devices. Responsiveness of site elements is controlled by CSS styling properties, such as flex and media queries.
