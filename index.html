        <h1>Brad Kelley</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Brad Kelley. I have over 25-years of experience as a technology consultant and recently endeavored to become a full-stack software developer. In 2002, I co-founded Mercury Associates, Inc. (“Mercury”), the largest independent fleet consulting and technology services firm in North America. I served as the firm’s Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for 20-years until the company was purchased by CDPQ, a leading global private equity platform. As the firms CTO, I led the firm's Technology Consulting Services & Cloud Services business lines, which provided advisory and technical services as well as SaaS and IaaS.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2020, I departed Mercury to pursue a long-time dream of becoming a software developer, creating native web applications with intuitive, visually stunning interfaces. I am particularly passionate about solutions that harmonize and visualize complex business activities in a “single pane of glass” – unifying diverse data streams and technologies, such as business systems, IoT and geospatial data, artificial intelligence, and analytics. Additionally, I am highly interested in skeuomorphic and neumorphic UI designs to improve software usability.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently pursuing a full-stack developer certification with Rice University, which should be awarded by April 2022. I also hold a master's in public administration (MPA) with Southern Illinois University and a bachelor's (BS) in international business with Spring Hill College.
        </p>
        <p>
          My wife, Bobi, and I have two adult children, four grandchildren, and five dogs. We also raise honey bees on our farm in New Waverly, Texas.

        <h2>Mobile Responsiveness</h2>
        <p>
          The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they
          travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. As part of my

        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
          The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an
          internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management (ORM)
          gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.
